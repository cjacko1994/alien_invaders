Interactive Media Project- BU BADMD Level I

Galaxy Wars is the result of a re-design of space invaders for a University project. It combines elements of the space genre, it uses a moving background image and contains a counter for the amount of kills achieved by the player, as well as giving them three lives. The movements remaint true to the original game, however the speed of fire, movement and the enemy positioning has been edited to offer a more fluid game play.
